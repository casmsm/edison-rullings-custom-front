If “Embodiment of Apophis” is your only monster in such a case, neither player can activate “Creature Swap”.\n●You can activate “Embodiment of Apophis” during your opponent’s Main Phase, or your own.\n●While “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, it is still treated as a Trap Card and can be destroyed by “Heavy Storm” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”.\n●If an effect that destroys Trap Cards is used against “Embodiment of Apophis”, you can use “Fake Trap” to prevent it from being destroyed. When preventing the destruction of “Embodiment of Apophis”, you must be using a card of the appropriate type. You can't use “My Body as a Shield” to rescue it from “Heavy Storm”. You can't use “Fake Trap” to rescue it from “Raigeki”. You can use “Riryoku Field” when “Embodiment of Apophis” is targeted by “Snatch Steal”, but not when it’s targeted by “Mystical Space Typhoon”. You can use any of these effects to protect “Embodiment of Apophis” from “Raigeki Break” because “Raigeki Break” can destroy a Monster card or a Trap Card.\n●vs. “Jinzo”: If “Emodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and “Jinzo” or “Royal Decree” is played, “Embodiment of Apophis” can't remain as a monster and is placed face-up in the Spell & Trap Card Zone, where it remains on the field meaninglessly (even if “Jinzo” leaves play later). If “Royal Decree” is chained to the activation of “Embodiment of Apophis”, the effect of “Embodiment of Apophis” is negated and it remains on the field in the Spell & Trap Card Zone meaninglessly.\n●If “Embodiment of Apophis” attacks a face-down “Jinzo”, once “Jinzo” is flipped face-up, “Embodiment of Apophis” reverts to a Trap Card. Damage calculation is not applied.\n●If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and is flipped face-down, it goes back to the Spell & Trap Card Zone as a Trap Card (vertically, since Trap Cards don't have battle positions). You can't activate “Embodiment of Apophis” that same turn, because it is a Trap Card that was just Set.\n●When “Embodiment of Apophis” is sent to the GY, it is sent as a Trap Card and remains treated as a Trap Card. You can't revive it with “Monster Reborn” or retrieve it with “Return of the Doomed”. It won't trigger “Last Will”. You can't activate “Michizure”. It won't be Special Summoned by “Red-Moon Baby”. No damage is inflicted by “KA-2 Des Scissors” or “Inferno” or “Fatal Abacus”. “Emes the Infinity” does not increase its ATK. No Life Points are increased by “Absorbing Kid from the Sky”. You would not gain Life Points for “Altar for Tribute”. (You can, however, now add it back to your hand with “Mask of Darkness”.)\n●If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster with “Snatch Steal” or “Creature Swap”, and it is flipped face-down, it goes to your opponent’s Spell & Trap Card Zone because he is the controller.\n●If your opponent controls your “Embodiment of Apophis” as a monster with “Snatch Steal”, and “Jinzo” is Summoned, it returns to your Spell & Trap Card Zone and remains there meaninglessly.

It does not inflict damage for “Ceasefire”. You can use “Delta Attacker” if you have 3 “Embodiment of Apophis” monsters. You can Tribute “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Sword of the Soul-Eater” while it is a monster.\n●If “Non-Spellcasting Area” is active, “Embodiment of Apophis” can't be destroyed by “Raigeki”, etc., but can still be destroyed by “Heavy Storm” or “Mystical Space Typhoon”.\n●“Embodiment of Apophis”, while a monster, has original ATK 1600 and original DEF 1800 (for purposes of “Megamorph”, etc.).\n●You can negate the activation of “Embodiment of Apophis” by chaining “Solemn Judgment” or “7 Tools of the Bandit” or “Royal Oppression”, but you can't use these against it once it is a monster.\n●When “Embodiment of Apophis” is Special Summoned, you can activate “Torrential Tribute” just like with any other Summon.\n●You can use “Chain Destruction” when “Embodiment of Apophis” is Special Summoned, and “Chain Destruction” will destroy all copies of “Embodiment of Apophis” in the hand and Deck even though they are Trap Cards.\n●You can use “Embodiment of Apophis” as a Tribute once it is a monster. You can't Tribute it for a Ritual Summon, etc., while it is in your hand.\n●If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster and “Morphing Jar #2” is activated, “Embodiment of Apophis” is shuffled into the Deck as a Trap Card, so it does NOT count towards the number of monsters you need to pick up. (Also, if you pick up “Embodiment of Apophis” for the effect of “Morphing Jar #2”, it is not counted as a monster and will be one of the cards sent to the GY.)\n●If you pick up “Embodiment of Apophis” for “Cyber Jar”, it is added to your hand.\n●If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster and is equipped to “Relinquished”, “Embodiment of Apophis” is treated as any other monster equipped to “Relinquished”, and “Relinquished” gets 1600 ATK and 1800 DEF.\n●If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, “Giant Trunade” will still return it to the owner’s hand.\n●When “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and is returned to the hand by “Penguin Soldier”, etc., it is returned as a Trap Card. So you can't activate “Major Riot”.\n●You can target “Embodiment of Apophis” with “Monster Recovery” while it is a monster, and return it to the Deck.\n●If “Embodiment of Apophis” is a monster, and you use “Magical Hats” with it, it returns to your Spell & Trap Card Zone face-down. The other effects of “Magical Hats” apply normally.\n●If “Embodiment of Apophis” battles “D.D. Warrior Lady” and her effect is activated, both will be removed from play.\n●If you select “Embodiment of Apophis” as your monster for “Last Turn”, it is not sent to the GY even though “Last Turn” sends all other cards to the GY.\n●If you control “Theban Nightmare” and “Embodiment of Apophis”, you control a Trap Card so the effect of “Theban Nightmare” can't be applied.\n●If you change “Embodiment of Apophis” to Machine-Type and use “Limiter Removal”, then “Jinzo” is Summoned later that turn and “Embodiment of Apophis” switches back to a Trap Card, “Embodiment of Apophis” is not destroyed in the End Phase by “Limiter Removal”.\n●If you use “Dimensionhole” or “Interdimensional Matter Transporter” against “Embodiment of Apophis”, it returns to the field as a Trap Card and is destroyed immediately. If “Dimensionhole” was used, you can't use the Monster Card Zone while “Embodiment of Apophis” is removed from play, but you can use the Spell & Trap Card Zone it was occupying.","PSCT":"No Edison-Accurate PSCT available for this card.","Atk":"","Def":""},{"id":24019261,"Name":"Emergency Assistance","Attribute":"SPELL","Text":"Activate during your Main Phase 2, to Special Summon 1 Level 4 monster from your GY that was destroyed by a card effect and sent to the GY this turn.","Type":"Normal","Rulings":"●This effect targets 1 monster.\n●A monster that was destroyed while being treated as a Spell Card can be Summoned by this effect.\n●You can only Special Summon a monster if it is Level 4 while in the GY.\n●You can Special Summon monsters that were destroyed while they were in your hand/Deck.","PSCT":"No Edison-Accurate PSCT available for this card.","Atk":"","Def":""},{"id":53046408,"Name":"Emergency Provisions","Attribute":"SPELL","Text":"Send any number of other Spell/Trap Cards you control to the GY; gain 1000 LP for each card sent to the GY this way.","Type":"Quick-Play","Rulings":"●Sending Spell and Trap Cards on your side of the field to the GY is a cost for activating this card.\n●You can activate a Normal Spell Card, such as Raigeki, then chain Emergency Provisions and send Raigeki to the GY to gain 1000 Life Points, and the effect of Raigeki will still resolve.\n●If your opponent activates Heavy Storm you can chain Emergency Provisions to send your Spell and Trap Cards to GY first (and gain the appropriate amount of Life Points).\n●You gain the Life Points from this card’s effect in one lump sum, so if you control Fire Princess her effect will only inflict 500 points of damage.\n●The effect of this card does not destroy your Spell and Trap Cards; it sends them to the GY.

If you draw a Normal Monster card for Chain Link 3 or Chain Link 2, your copies of “Heart of the Underdog” don't activate again. This is because they are “when… you can” optional Trigger Effects, and you “miss the timing” because you drew the Normal Monster Card during a chain and not as Chain Link 1. However, if you draw a Normal Monster Card for Chain Link 1, all 3 copies of “Heart of the Underdog” will activate their effects again.\n●“Heart of the Underdog” doesn’t only activate if you draw a Normal Monster Card for your standard draw. It will also activate its effect if you draw a Normal Monster Card with a card effect such as “Reload”, “Jar of Greed”, or “Heart of the Underdog”.\n●When you draw a Normal Monster Card, if you want to activate the effect of “Heart of the Underdog” you have to show it to your opponent immediately.

A card like “Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon” is not a Normal Monster Card.\n●When you show a Normal Monster Card to your opponent to activate “Heart of the Underdog”, your opponent can chain “Drop Off”. You will have to discard that Normal Monster Card, but “Heart of the Underdog” still resolves its effect.\n●If you draw multiple cards at the same time during your Draw Phase, such as with “Reload”, only 1 of the cards needs to be a Normal Monster to trigger “Heart of the Underdog”, since they are all drawn at the same time.

It gains 300 ATK/DEF. If it attacks, it gains ATK equal to half the ATK of the attack target, during damage calculation only.","Type":"Normal","Rulings":"●If you equip a monster with 2 or more copies of “Metalmorph”, the effect of each copy of “Metalmorph” is applied. For example, if you equip 2 “Metalmorph” onto a monster it will gain 600 ATK and DEF and when the equipped monster attacks your opponent’s monster its ATK will be increased further by the effect of each “Metalmorph”.\n●If “Reverse Trap” is activated, the increase of 300 ATK and DEF is changed into a decrease of 300 ATK and DEF. When your monster that is equipped with “Metalmorph” attacks your opponent’s monster, the additional gained ATK, that is based on the ATK of the monster being attacked, is NOT changed to a decrease.\n●The additional ATK gained when your equipped monster attacks your opponent’s monster is applied when you attack a face-up or face-down monster. This effect does not target.\n●If you have a Warrior-Type monster equipped with “Metalmorph” and it attacks your opponent’s “Kinetic Soldier”, the effect of “Kinetic Soldier” is resolved first. The monster equipped with “Metalmorph” will gain ATK equal to half of “Kinetic Soldier’s” total ATK.\n●If your monster that is equipped with “Metalmorph” attacks your opponent’s “Injection Fairy Lily”, if your opponent activates “Injection Fairy Lily’s” effect it will be resolved first, and then after “Injection Fairy Lily’s” ATK is increased by 3000 your monster will gain additional ATK equal to half of “Injection Fairy Lily’s” total ATK.\n●If your monster that is equipped with “Metalmorph” attacks your opponent’s “Elemental Hero Wildheart”, your monster will still gain additional ATK because “Metalmorph” does not affect the monster that is being attacked.\n●When you monster that is equipped with “Metalmorph” attacks your opponent’s “The Wicked Avatar”, first you will apply the additional gained ATK based on the current ATK of “The Wicked Avatar”, and then if your equipped monster becomes the monster with the highest ATK on the field, the ATK of “The Wicked Avatar” will be recalculated.\n●Example: Player A has “Cannon Soldier” equipped with “Metalmorph” (1400 + 300 = 1700 ATK). “Cannon Soldier” is the monster with the highest ATK on the field, so “The Wicked Avatar” has 1800 ATK (1700 + 100 = 1800 ATK). When “Cannon Soldier” attacks “The Wicked Avatar”, the additional ATK is applied, giving “Cannon Soldier” a total of 2600 ATK (1800/2 + 1700 = 2600). “The Wicked Avatar’s” ATK is then recalculated to 2700 (2600 + 100 = 2700) and damage is calculated.
